# svelte app

This is my project template for [Svelte](https://svelte.dev). It is configured to use typescript, babel with common-js for polyfills, and tailwindcss.

- Full typescript support
- Transpiling using babel with automatic common-js polyfills
- Tailwindcss
- Full support for hot reload

To create a new project based on this template using [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit):

```bash
npx degit RedstoneWizard22/svelte-ts-babel-tailwind svelte-app
```

## The Setup

## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd svelte-app
npm install
```

...then start webpack:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and the page should reload with your changes.
